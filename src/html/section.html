A card back section is an iframe that gets rendered on the back of a card, above the attachments section. You give the section a title and icon, and tell Trello what page to load into the iframe.

Your Power-Up can have only one card back section and a maximum height of 1500 pixels.

card-back-section iframes are reloaded whenever pluginData is changed on the card via t.set().

Card back sections shouldn't be used to display information regarding the attachments on the cardâ€“for that, you can use attachment-sections.
